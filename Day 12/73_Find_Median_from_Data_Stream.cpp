// Optimised Approach - TC: O(logn)  SC: O(n)
// --------------------------------------------
// MaxHeap to store a half of low numbers, MinHeap to store a half of high numbers

// 1. The idea is to divide numbers into 2 balanced halves, one half low stores low numbers, the other half high stores high
// numbers. To access the median in O(1), we need a data structure that give us the maximum of low half and the minimum of high
// half in O(1). That's where maxHeap and minHeap come into play.

// 2. We use maxHeap to store a half of low numbers, top of the maxHeap is the highest number among low numbers.

// 3. We use minHeap to store a half of high numbers, top of the minHeap is the lowest number among high numbers.

// 4. We need to balance the size between maxHeap and minHeap while processing. Hence after adding k elements,
//  - If k = 2 * i then maxHeap.size = minHeap.size = i
//  - If k = 2 * i + 1, let maxHeap store 1 element more than minHeap, then maxHeap.size = minHeap.size + 1.

// 5. When adding a new number num into our MedianFinder:
//  - Firstly, add num to the maxHeap, now maxHeap may contain the big element (which should belong to minHeap). So we need to
//  balance, by removing the highest element from maxHeap, and offer it to minHeap.
//  - Now, the minHeap might hold more elements than maxHeap, in that case, we need to balance the size, by removing the lowest
//  element from minHeap and offer it back to maxHeap.

// 6. When doing findMedian():
//  - If maxHeap.size > minHeap.size return top of the maxHeap, which is the highest number amongs low numbers.
//  - Else if maxHeap.size == minHeap return the (maxHeap.top() + minHeap.top()) / 2.
